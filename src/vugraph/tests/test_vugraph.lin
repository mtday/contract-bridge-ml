pc|cK|pc|c7|pc|d8|pc|c5|pg||

nt|brolucius: Anyway, that's a rare case than wanting to do something with the majors.|pg||
nt|dburn: well, if partner is prone to opening 2@d on five to the jack, it may be better to redouble with no preference and pass with long diamonds|pg||

mb|1S|nt|brolucius: That is no more than average.|pg||

nt|brolucius: We are not talking stomach measurements.|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Are you suggesting they are average commentators?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sarah, Bryony and Roland are unique. Take that, guys!|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Mark my words|pg||
nt|vugraphe1: Wolfarth asks what x would be after 1NT (pens)|pg||
nt|benjy: who votes for 1NT and who for X?|pg||
nt|jtr: Mark your name too....|pg||
nt|bryony: Ha ha!  I am, in fact, the only Bryony in the US!|pg||
nt|brolucius: Another excellent use of transfers by responder (also used over a take-out double). |pg||
nt|chessmaste: I don't care for 1NT - no tricks - all defence - but we all do it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|benjy: presumably you would X then or would you bid 1Nt and not like it?|pg||
nt|dburn: curiously, there are about 300 women in the USA whose Christian name is Unique|pg||
pc|d3|nt|brolucius: Yes, because passing is so risky in these days of light openings and responses.|pg||
nt|steshome: Thanks Roland.  I was starting to worry about being more than average.  It didn't sound like above average.  You are making that up about Uniques, surely|pg||
nt|brolucius: Where did you meet them?|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|nt|chessmaste: I prefer 1NT - if I have to bid|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|sQ|pc|s6|pg||
nt|bryony: I see Tosh chose to X in the other room and that didn't work out too well|pg||
nt|chessmaste: This will be a little more for Wolfarth|pg||
nt|dburn: meanwhile, Crouch will - or at any rate can - make 2@s, but will lose 3 IMPs if he does|pg||
nt|brolucius: "Do you, Unique, take David as your...."|pg||
nt|benjy: if you X once i think it is super agressive to X again|pg||
nt|jtr: 1NT is ok if partner hasnt passed|pg||
nt|benjy: he was perhaps a little bit lucky to escape a X|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|s9|nt|chessmaste: A fair point - but still dangerous|pg||
pc|s4|pg||

nt|jallerton: I agree a @h lead could have been right (I would have led one) but it's easy to see how a trump lead could be the winner|pg||
nt|jchiu: this could certainly be two down if Isporski finds the heart ruff ... Hallberg is just glad not to be doubled here|pg||
nt|jallerton: On this hand, I don't like West's actions|pg||
nt|sybarra: you prefer 1 nt? |pg||
nt|jchiu: I would have overcalled 1N myself|pg||
nt|jchiu: that second double is begging for trouble|pg||

nt|brolucius: I don't agree with that. On some hands partner will have a clear-cut decision one way or another. On the others, he can guess as well as you, probably. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: In this room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They are on 39 in the other room|pg||

mb|1C!|mb|1S|mb|d|nt|steshome: A crucial hand|pg||
nt|benjy: Daid (Bird) you are on your own 4@S is the down th middle completely normal action on the board|pg||
nt|brolucius: 6@C was no certainty to make (from South's point of view) in the other room. The strong 1@C opener had rebid only 2@C opposite a negative.|pg||
nt|steshome: I agree with Ben.  Strange feeling|pg||
mb|2N!|an|GF !S raise|nt|jtr: TY Ben|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|rmb1: Time for team Liggins to do something|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jchiu: or passed it around to Isporski who may be able to|pg||

nt|bryony: Which other pair from the Liggins team are playing in the closed room?|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Hallberg - Tosh|pg||
mb|3N!|mb|p|mb|4C!|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|Walddk2: There is at least one flaw, so Wolfarth should take out|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: With only one suit stopped, Wolfarth cannot leave in the Gambing 3NT.|pg||
nt|jtr: another swing hand|pg||
nt|jtr: 5@d i would think now|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: wrong as it is on the hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He did the right thing|pg||
nt|benjy: what do you think of the X on the north cards|pg||
nt|jtr: well judged|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|brolucius: East will expect 4@S to make, but in that case 5@D might cost 500.|pg||
nt|benjy: it could be very wrong if partner bids 4Hs|pg||

nt|bryony: He was fortuante his partner's majors weren't the other way round...|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Welcome back to David Burn|pg||
nt|benjy: then what ios the point of doubling|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|benjy: you think  you might want to play in 5@C?|pg||
nt|bryony: In case partner wanted to leave it in?|pg||
nt|dburn: Hello|pg||
nt|chessmaste: This looks like a good start for Wolfarth|pg||
pc|c5|nt|brolucius: There is no way for them to allow 4@S to make (famous last words).|pg||

nt|j_bgood: no - of course that is right - it is normal to pay the insurance premium in such situations|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|d|mb|3S|nt|jchiu: the 3NT opening by Hyett certainly got Crouch a bit high here|pg||

pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||

nt|jchiu: tosh needs to shoot a heart through to avoid endplaying gunnar|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c3|pg||
nt|jchiu: assuming Isporski guesses trumps, which he may well due to lack of enterprise by E/W, six more imps to Wolfarth|pg||
nt|j_bgood: no shot - still one man down|pg||
nt|jallerton: will probably play for @s 2-2 with no bidding over 3@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: and can see his @C dont stretch |pg||
nt|finch: He knows diamonds are probably 7-2 from the signals, but playing East for long spades also works|pg||
nt|jallerton: can't East have J10x?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|nt|jallerton: should rise as may be able to endplay E if the latter has Qxx and 2/3 clubs|pg||
nt|jchiu: that would "endplay" west if Tosh had @SQxx|pg||
nt|jchiu: it would give him another chance to push a heart through at least|pg||
nt|j_bgood: if he plays the ace i think it is over |pg||

pc|c8|pc|c9|pc|cK|pc|d3|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I am wondering if they have 4 more boards on hand in case this ends with a tie|pg||
nt|brolucius: Had West switched to a heart, instead of his singleton club (which looked more attractive), it would have been two down.|pg||
nt|brolucius: With a 2-IMP margin, even dull-looking boards take on a certain lustre.|pg||
